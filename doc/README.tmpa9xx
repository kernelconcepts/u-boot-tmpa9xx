Summary
=======

This README is about U-Boot support for Toshiba ARM 926EJS based family of SoCs.

Currently the following boards are supported:

* BMSKTOPASA910 aka Topas910

* BMSKTOPASA900 aka TopasA900

* Glyn TMPA900 CPU BOARD aka Tonga2

Build
=====

The Topas 910 and TopasA 900 boards have both, NOR and NAND Flash, while
the Tonga2 board only has NAND Flash available.


Topas910 NOR Image:
make topas910_config
make

Topas910 NAND Image:
make topas910_nand_config
make

TopasA900 NOR Image:
make topasa900_config
make

TopasA900 NAND Image:
make topas900_nand_config
make

Tonga2 NAND Image:
make tonga2_config
make

As there is no NAND writing support for JTAG interfaces available at
the moment you first have to flash the NOR images once to the
Topas based boards. After starting the NOR Image you are able to flash the
NAND image from the NOR based u-boot.

The Tonga2 Board comes with preinstalled u-boot NAND image.
You could just update to a new image by overwriting the old version with the new one.
Further information for the Tonga2 platform could be found at:

Bootloader
==========
Booting up from NOR is straight forward as the NOR is mapped to the chip.
Booting from NAND is using internal Rom Bootloader.
This one is loading the autoboot.bin (inside nand_tmpa9x0).
This code then sets up the memory and clocks and loads the u-boot from the NAND.
The autoboot code is closed source and is not public.
If you need this code you have to sign NDA with Toshiba.
